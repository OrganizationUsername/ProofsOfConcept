## Functionality
The program checks the distance from circles to the edge of a rectangular plate and other circles. The basis of the check is a fictional demand and capacity. 

## Future Enhancements
- Excel integrations
- Better window resizing
- Implement Undo/Redo functionality
- Replace canvas element
- Separate Model and UI
- Round rectangle thicknesses to user-defined values
- Smooth thickness values to match a maximum of n values
- Allow arbitrary polygons in place of the rectangle
- Allow arbitrary user-defined demand/capacity functions

## Bugs
Certain aspects of the UI may not update after adding/removing/editing shapes.
